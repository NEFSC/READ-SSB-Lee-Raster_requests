# Purpose

A small will contain code used to finagle the raster data into products that the fisheries managers can use.

It relies heavily on the offshoreWind project.  It adds three pieces of functionality:
1.  Construction of geotiffs
1.  Checking the geotiffs to ensure confidentiality
1.  Subsetting of "all trips" based on gear or catch.

# Prelude
Look on my code, ye Mighty, and despair!

# Folder structure

Code will go into the ./R_code/ folder. I'll organize into FMP and then action. Hopefully I can figure out how to do everything into R and not have to write any stata code.

Raw data, tables, geotiffs, and images will go into ./raw_data/ again, organized by FMP and then action.
