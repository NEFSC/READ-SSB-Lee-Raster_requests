 This only works when you knit, not when you run a chunk.

# Summary (do not include)
GARFO is leading an omnibus amendment to the Fishery Management Plans of the MA and NE Fishery Management Councils.  The proposed action would  affect vessels that hold a permit for any of the thirteen fishery management plans or for the American Lobster and Jonah Crab fisheries.  The proposed action would implement regulations to prohibit commercial fishing activities in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts National Monument; Red crab and American lobster commercial fishing would be exempt until September 15, 2023. Recreational fishing activities are not affected.  

Commercial fishing, except for red crab and lobster, in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts National Monument (NCSMNM) was prohibited from September 15, 2016 to June 5, 2020 (Presidential Proclamation 9496).  From June 6, 2020 to October 8, 2021, commercial fishing was allowed (Proclamation 10049).   The entirety of the NCSMNM is currently closed to fishing by Presidential Proclamation 10287 under the Antiquities Act.  82% of the NCSMNM is within the Georges Bank Deep Sea Coral Area through the NEFMC's Habitat Omnibus Amendment 2 and commercial fishing except red crab has been closed since July 26, 2021.  18% of the NCSMNM is not contained in the Georges Bank Deep Sea Coral Area is the focus of the economic analysis and is referred to as the "NCSMNM Addition" (Figure \ref{fig:map_NCSMNM}).

## Economic and Social Effects

### Economic Effects{#Econ-Effects}

The proposed action would close the entirety of the NCSMNM to commercial fishing. Commercial fishing for red crab and American Lobster can continue until September 15, 2023.  82% of the NCSMNM lies within the Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area, where commercial fishing, except with red crab pots, is currently prohibited.  

Therefore, the economic analysis focuses on the 18% of NCSMNM that is not contained with the Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area.  The analysis also focuses on the long-run and examines the continued closure of the NCSMNM to all gears, including Red Crab and Lobster gear.

#### Baseline Description - the Fishery {#Baseline_Description_Fishery}

A reasonable baseline is the *status quo* condition.  82% of the NCSMNM is contained within the Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area and fishing with all gear except red crab pot/trap gear continues to be prohibited in this area in the baseline.  Landings and revenue from recent years are used to describe the baseline economic conditions.  The Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Area has been closed since July 26, 2021, so data from recent years (when fishing *was* permitted the Deep-Sea Coral area) may not give the full picture of the baseline conditions.  Therefore, in addition to summarizing the average landings and revenue, by FMP in Table \ref{tab:baseline_revenues}, the average revenue derived from  the Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area is also presented in column four of Table \ref{tab:baseline_revenues}.  It is likely that a large proportion of the fishing activity in column four has migrated to a different part of the ocean.  All dollars and are normalized to  `r base_year` real values, using the GDP Deflator.

```


Under the *status quo* baseline, commercial fishing in the 18% of the NCSMNM not contained within the Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area is prohibited by Presidential Proclamation under the Antiquities Act.  As seen from historical record, the types of allowed activities in the area can easily be changed by presidential proclamation to include or not include commercial fishing.  It is therefore reasonable to infer that a future administration may prefer to allow commercial fishing in the NCSMNM and consider the economic effects of this as part of the baseline. 

If commercial fishing is allowed inside NCSMNM, additional benefits would accrue to the fishing industry.  These would be positively related to the amount of fishing that would occur in 18% of NCSMNM.  We are unable to estimate producer surplus measures associated with fishing inside this area; we therefore characterize the revenue from fishing that would occur inside this area. We use commercial fishing data from  `r START.YEAR` - `r END.YEAR` time due to the changing status of fishing inside the NCSMNM after `r END.YEAR`. 

<!---
Under the *status quo* baseline, the coral, sponges, and other underwater fauna are to be protected from impacts of commercial fishing gear by Presidential Proclamation under the Antiquities Act.  These unique attributes continue to provide non-use economic benefits (bequest and existence) as described in the statement of market failure (Section \ref{market_failure}); however, there are no benefits related to direct commercial extraction inside NCSMNM.  Finally, the habitat itself will regenerate and likely improve in quality after the cessation of fishing activities, increasing some non-use economic benefits in the future. 

If commercial fishing is allowed inside NCSMNM, the extractive and non-extractive flow of benefits will change.  Additional benefits would accrue to both the fishing industry and consumers of seafood.  These would be positively related to the amount of fishing that would occur in 18% of NCSMNM.  We are unable to estimate producer or consumer surplus measures associated with fishing inside this area; we therefore characterize the revenue from fishing that would occur inside this area. We use commercial fishing data from  `r START.YEAR` - `r END.YEAR` time due to the changing status of fishing after `r END.YEAR`. All dollars and are normalized to  `r base_year` real values, using the GDP Deflator.


If commercial fishing is allowed, the quality of habitat inside NCSMNM would decline in proportion to the increase in fishing effort.  Different types of gear have different effects on the bottom.  Both the decrease in quality of the habitat stock and the economic costs that decline in quality are difficult to quantify.  In Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia canyons, the hard canyon walls provide habitats for sponges, corals, and other invertebrates that filter food from the water to flourish, and for larger species including squid, octopus, skates, flounders, and crabs. Major oceanographic features, such as currents, temperature gradients, eddies, and fronts, occur on a large scale and influence the distribution patterns of such highly migratory oceanic species as tuna, billfish, and sharks. They provide feeding grounds for these and many other marine species.  

Some types of gear (say midwater trawl or handline) has minimal effects on the ocean bottom compared to others (say Trawl or Dredge). Table \ref{tab:revenue_table_by_gear} describes the economic activity, disaggregated by gear, projected to occur inside the NCSMNM addition if reopened. These proved insight into both the effects of fishing effort on the sea bottom and the types of commercial users that may benefit from the opening of the NCSMNM.

--->

We project the gross revenues and landings that would occur inside the NCSMNM addition area.  We use commercial fishing data based on vessel trip reports from  `r START.YEAR` - `r END.YEAR` time make this characterization. This time period is selected because the changing status of fishing makes data after `r END.YEAR` less useful for characterizing fishing activity if the NCSMNM were reopened.   These projected landings and revenues were constructed using the methods described in [@DePiper2014; @Benjamin2018] and were also used in a he similar analysis in support of the NEFMC's Habitat Omnibus Amendment 2 [-@NEFMC_habitat_2016_V6]. In brief, fishing vessels report the location (latitude and longitude) where the majority of their fishing effort was located. Fishing activity does not actually occur at a single point in the ocean.  A model, based on data collected through the observer program is used to account for this by allocating the fishing activity over a more realistic area. The amount of allocated effort that occurs inside the NCSMNM addition over the `r START.YEAR` to `r END.YEAR` period is used to construct projected revenues and landings that would occur if the NCSMNM addition was reopened to commercial fishing.

These projections *under-estimate* fishing activity attributable to the lobster fishery and pot/trap gears because vessel operators that hold a lobster permit and no other federal permit are not required to fill out vessel trip reports.  Of the 113 fishing vessels with an Area 3 lobster permit in 2018, 90 were required to file VTRs because they held other Northeast Region permits.

Table \ref{tab:top_fmp_revenue_table} projects landings and revenue that is likely to occur inside the NCSMNM addition if reopened.   These tables provide insight into likely annual flows of benefits of resuming fishing in the NCSMNM addition and the types of firms to which those benefits would accrue *in the baseline*. Figures \ref{fig:top_fmp_landings_plots} and \ref{fig:top_fmp_revenue_figure}  describe landings and  landings from `r START.YEAR` - `r END.YEAR` that occurred within the NCSMNM boundary addition disaggregated by FMP and year.  These provide insight into the likely year-to-year variation of those benefits.

To convert the annual flow of uncertain future economic activity in Tables \ref{tab:top_fmp_revenue_table} and \ref{tab:revenue_table_by_gear} into  current values, it is necessary to adjust for both the probability that fishing will occur and when it will occur.  We refrain from an assessment of either of these figures, but note that both factors will reduce the values shown in in Tables \ref{tab:top_fmp_revenue_table} and \ref{tab:revenue_table_by_gear}.

Two caveats are necessary. First, these tables and figures *under-represent* fishing activity attributable to the lobster fishery and pot/trap gears because vessel operators that hold a lobster permit and no other federal permit are not required to fill out vessel trip reports. Therefore, it *under-estimates* the annual fishing activity associated with a resumption of commercial fishing in the NCSMNM addition.

Second, these figures represent activity that is likely to occur if commercial fishing can resume in the NCSMNM addition, but are likely to *over-estimate* the benefits to the fishing industry.  This occurs for a few reasons. First, firm profits must be less than gross revenues, because there are costs associated with harvesting fish. Second, not all of the fishing activity described in Figures \ref{fig:top_fmp_landings_plots} and \ref{fig:top_fmp_revenue_figure} represents "new" fishing activity that would be undertaken in the NCSMNM addition area.  Some of this economic activity stems from fishing trips that currently occur in similar (and presumably less profitable) locations.  For these trips, the gains associated the NCSMNM addition is the difference in profits between fishing in the current locations and fishing in NCSMNM.

<!-- Table \ref{tab:total_fishing_START} describes landings and real revenues over the  `r START.YEAR` - `r END.YEAR` time period, disaggregated by Fishery Management Plan, in all areas.  Landings and Revenue derived from Jonah Crab are aggregated into the Lobster FMP. Landings and revenue derived from Red Crab are aggregated into the "Other NER" category.  These data *under-represent* fishing activity attributable to the lobster fishery because vessel operators that hold a lobster permit and no other federal permit are not required to fill out vessel trip reports. -->

#### Baseline Description - Other sources of Economic Value

The seafloor status in NCSMNM can be thought of as a capital asset.  Beyond it's value derived from the unique ecological resources that are subject to scientific interest, the seafloor provides ecoystem services, including habitat for species that are commercially valuable.  The quality of the capital asset decreases after fishing occurs when bottom-contact from fishing gear damages the unique oceanographic formations or destroys marine life.  Because fauna in the area (like deep-sea coral and sponges) grow, the habitat can slowly regenerate after these events. However, coral and sponges are fragile, slow-growing, and relatively immobile, so even small amounts of intermittent activity may have long-lasting, negative impacts on the stock of habitat in NCSMNM. 

NCSMNM can provide economic benefits in through extractive and non-extractive means.  First, high-quality habitat can increase the stocks of recreationally and commercially exploited species.  It may also agglomerate stocks of exploited species, making them easier to harvest.  Although commercial fishing is currently prohibited in the NCSMNM, a portion of these extractive benefits still exist: mature fish move in and out of the protected area and produce offspring that move outside the protected area [@Holland1996] These are extractive uses.  Second, the NCSMNM can be associated with existence and bequest uses: the people of the nation may derive value  from knowing the NCSMNM exists and knowing that it will continue to exist for future generations. 

Figure \ref{fig:landings_gear_plot} and Table \ref{tab:revenue_table_by_gear} describe landings from `r START.YEAR` to `r END.YEAR` that occurred within the NCSMNM boundary addition. They are disaggregated by gear to provide some insight into the possible declines in the stock of habitat in the area if fishing resumed.  We note that most of the catch in the NCSMNM is from gear that gear that  contacts the bottom while active (Dredge, Bottom Trawl).


<!---
A reduction in ecosystem benefits stemming from reduced protection in NCSMNM represents a cost to society.  A reduction in compliance costs for the fishing industry stemming from reduced protections in NCSMNM represents benefits to society. The proposed action would remove both of remove the probability of these changes.  This can be counter-intuitive for people.
--->


#### Economic Effects of the Proposed Regulation 

The proposed action would make not changes to the types of fishing activities that can be currently conducted in the NCSMNM; fishing is likely to continue at levels described in Table \ref{tab:baseline_revenues}.  However, the proposed action greatly reduces the probability that the NCSMNM addition would reopened to commercial fishing in the future. This change in probability has benefits and costs to the nation.

Relative to the baseline, the benefits of the proposed action include annual bequest values, existence values, and incremental contribution of the NCSMNM habitat to the productivity of commercial valuable resources that are harvested outside of the NCSMNM areas.  These must be adjusted by the probability that the protections for NCSMNM would be rescinded in the future and discounted from that unknown point in time to the current time.   All of these values are difficult to quantify.

Relative to the baseline, the costs of the proposed action are equal to the losses in societal welfare (a combination of producer and consumer welfare) associated with the inability to fish in the NCSMNM.  These also must be adjusted by the probability that the protections for NCSMNM would be rescinded in the future and discounted from that unknown point in time to the current time.  We are unable to estimate the changes societal welfare from fishing within in the areas of the preferred alternative. Instead we present an estimate of revenue and landings that may return to the NCSMNM addition as an estimate of the potential scale of the industry.  These revenue and landings figures are contained in Table \ref{tab:revenue_table_by_gear} and  Figures \ref{fig:top_fmp_landings_plots} -\ref{fig:revenue_gear_plot}.

## Regulatory Impact Analysis and Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

This document provides the analysis and conclusions to address the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).  NMFS requires the preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for all regulatory actions that either implement or significantly amend a Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The RIA provides a comprehensive review of the changes in net economic benefits to society associated with proposed regulatory actions. This analysis reviews the problems and policy objectives prompting the regulatory proposals and evaluates the alternatives presented as a solution. This analysis ensures that we systematically and comprehensively consider all available alternatives so public welfare can be enhanced in the most efficient and cost-effective way. This RIA addresses multiple items in the regulatory philosophy and principles of Executive Order (EO) 12866. 

An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA; section [Regulatory-Flexibility-Act-Analysis]) has been prepared to further evaluate the economic impacts of the various alternatives presented in this document on regulated small business entities. --->

## Regulatory Impact Analysis (E.O. 12866)

The purpose of Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) is to enhance planning and coordination with respect to new and existing regulations. This E.O. requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review regulatory programs that are considered to be “significant.” E.O. 12866 requires a review of proposed regulations to determine whether or not the expected effects would be significant, where a significant action is any regulatory action that may:

*  Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
*  Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
*  Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
*  Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set for the Executive Order.
 
In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider. 

Fishing in NCSMNM (with limited temporary exceptions) is currently prohibited by presidential proclamation and the propsed action does not change the currently allowed fishing areas.  Instead, the proposed action codifies Proclamation 9496, as amended by Proclamation 10287, into regulation. These proclamations directed the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to promulgate regulations necessary for the proper care and management of the Monument. 
The costs, relative to the *status quo*, are opportunity cost of fishing adjusted by the likelihood that future administrations would reopen the NCSMNM to commercial fishing. Fishing in much of the NCSMNM (with limited exceptions) is currently also prohibited through the Georges Bank Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area, which was implemented through the NEFMC's Omnibus Deep-Sea Coral Amendment (86 FR 33553).

The benefits, relative to the *status quo*, are derived from an increased level of certainty in improving the condition of corals, sponges, and other deep-sea fauna in NCSMNM and indirectly improving the production of other species which rely on this habitat. Due to data limitations we were not able to quantify the costs or benefits of this rule associated with habitat conservation. Still, we believe that the overall impact of the proposed rule falls well short of the annual \$100 million threshold for a significant economic action because Vessel Trip Reports indicate that fishing vessels would derive \$1-2 million in annual gross revenue from the NCSMNM Addition. 


### Management Goals and Objectives

The goal of this amendment is to protect the geological, ecological, and biological resources within the Monument.  This amendment is needed to codify Proclamation 9496, as amended by Proclamation 10287, which directs the Secretaries to promulgate regulations necessary for the proper care and management of the Monument.

### Description of the Fishery and other affected entitites

See Section 3.0 for a description of the fisheries.  Section \ref{Baseline_Description_Fishery} summarizes relevant aspects of the fishery.

### Statement of the Problem - Market Failure {#market_failure}

Habitat inside NCSMNM is important for a  host of species including managed species such as cod and American anglerfish, and unmanaged species including a host of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.  Deep-sea corals and other fauna in the NCSMNM are slow growing and some species have limited dispersal capability. These features, combined with the branching and sometimes brittle structure of some taxa, make them vulnerable to mechanical disturbance, such as from fishing gear.  

NCSMNM can provide economic benefits in through extractive and non-extractive means.  First, high-quality habitat can increase the stocks of recreationally and commercially exploited species.  It may also agglomerate stocks of exploited species, making them easier to harvest.  These benefits  do not necessarily cease when commercial fishing inside the areas is prohibited: mature fish may move outside the protected area or produce offspring that move outside the protected area [@Holland1996] These are extractive uses.  Second, the NCSMNM can be associated with existence and bequest uses: the people of the nation may derive value  from knowing the NCSMNM exists and knowing that it will continue to exist for future generations.  

As a nonmarket good subject to open access, habitat is a good that economists expect to be overutilized without management intervention.  This is because the impacts of fishing on both the structure and function of deep-sea coral is not factored into an individual fisherman’s decision-making. In the absence of corrective policies, the actions of individual profit-maximizing firms imposes an externality; excess degradation of habitat above and beyond a socially optimal level. For quickly regenerating substrate and habitat, like featureless sandy bottoms with high flow of water, the practical effects of these externalities are likely minimal.  However, for habitat in the NCSMNM, the effects may be larger.  First, the functional degradation of habitat can impact the productivity of managed and unmanaged species that rely on the flora and fauna in the area. These impacts can lead to decreases in the future flow of benefits derived from recreationally and commercially exploited species. Second, these impacts can decrease the flow of nonuse values such as bequest and existence value of both the habitat and environment, including things like deep sea coral and other species.  

A cause and effect relationship between high-quality habitat and fish populations is hard to determine, and our understanding of relationships between deep-sea corals and fishes is situational and inferential (e.g., Baker et al. 2012), particularly in seamount habitats [@auster2007linking]. At the Gulf of Maine sites, economically important species were observed in coral habitats, including Acadian redfish (juveniles, adults, and pregnant females), haddock, pollock, cusk, monkfish, cod, silver hake, Atlantic herring, spiny dogfish, squid, and lobster. There is recent evidence that deep-sea corals play an important role in the early life history of some fish and shark species, providing nursery grounds and habitat for protection, reproduction, and feeding [@costello2005role] . @baillon2012deep collected sea pens as trawl bycatch during routine multispecies research surveys and found convincing evidence that several species of sea pens, including *Pennatula aculeata*, *Anthoptilum grandiflorum*, *Pennatula grandis*, and *Halipteris finmarchica*, are being directly utilized as shelter by fish larvae, mainly by those of the redfish (*Sebastes* spp.), one species of which is federally managed under the Northeast Large Mesh Multispecies FMP.  Thus, though the co-occurrence of deep sea coral and species of interest is suggestive, the extent to which productivity of managed and unmanaged species relies on these deep sea coral is highly uncertain, even in qualitative terms. 

The economic values of conservation associated with deep sea corals, including bequest and existence values, are not as well studied as those associated with tropical corals (Figure \ref{fig:coral_lit_table}). What value estimates exist focuses on two countries, Norway and Ireland, and in reality rely on only 3 datasets.  Of note is that a number of these studies indicate heterogeneity in both individual’s willingness to pay for conservation across both countries and allowable activities within conservation areas. For example, @armstrong2019willingness indicates that the Irish public are less willing than Norwegians to trade extractive activities such as fishing and mining off against conservation, the latter weighing pure existence value higher than the former. Additionally, @lariviere2014value, @aanesen2015willingness; @sandorf2016valuing, and @sandorf2017disentangling all rely on the same data, with the differences in estimates depending on how the heterogeneity in preferences across individuals is modeled.  A similar heterogeneity between both individuals and allowable uses has been identified in the Northeast, with some individuals even reporting negative willingness to pay for increases in the size of marine protected areas [@wallmo2008estimating]. The literature search highlights that estimated values are sensitive to the context in which they are solicited, and should account for heterogeneity in preferences for conservation. The values presented in Table 1 thus do not provide great clarity in informing estimation of the value of deep sea coral conservation undertaken within this action. As such, we discuss the benefits of deep sea coral conservation in a qualitative manner. The preferred alternatives designate three coral zones along the shelf break out to the EEZ boundary and in the inshore Gulf of Maine. Given the location of these zones and the specific fishing restriction measures associated with them, they are not likely to cause substantial displacement of fishing effort and therefore substantial increased conservation in the near term, but they will prevent expansion of fishing into these areas in the future. Thus, the benefits of this action derived from conservation of deep-sea corals and managed resources which utilize coral habitats are expected to be positive in direction, but slight in magnitude, and accrue over a long time horizon.

### Economic impacts relative to the baseline
The proposed action would make not changes to the types of fishing activities that can be currently conducted in the NCSMNM; fishing is likely to continue at levels described in Table \ref{tab:baseline_revenues}.  However, the proposed action greatly reduces the probability that the NCSMNM addition would reopened to commercial fishing in the future. 

Relative to the baseline, the costs of the proposed action are equal to the losses in societal welfare (a combination of producer and consumer welfare) associated with the inability to fish in the NCSMNM.  These also must be adjusted by the probability that the protections for NCSMNM would be rescinded in the future and discounted from that unknown point in time to the current time.  We are unable to estimate the changes societal welfare from fishing within in the areas of the preferred alternative.  Instead we present an estimate of revenue and landings that may return to the NCSMNM addition as an estimate of the potential scale of the industry.  The economic impacts on the fishery are described in Section \ref{Econ-Effects} are briefly summarized here. Gross receipts in the Northeast fishing industry average \$1.4B per year (Table \ref{tab:baseline_revenues}).  The proposed regulation would preclude commercial fishing in the NCSMNM addition; the regulated fishing vessels are projected to derive just under \$1M from fishing inside the NCSMNM addition area.  These are revenues that are foregone and gives a sense of the scale of the economic effects on the fishing industry.  The scallop fishery would experience the highest impacts in  dollar values (\$590,000).  The Mackerel, Squid, and butterfish fishery would experience the largest impacts in term of volume (137,000 lbs).  In relative terms, all fisheries derive well under 1\% of revenue from the NCSMNM addition area. 

Relative to the baseline, the benefits of the proposed action include annual bequest values, existence values, and incremental contribution of the NCSMNM habitat to the productivity of commercial valuable resources that are harvested outside of the NCSMNM areas.  We note that these values may increase rapidly when habitat is in a high quality stat.  Due to the slow growing nature of the fauna in NCSMNM, even short bursts of fishing effort that contacts the bottom could degrade the habitat quickly.  These benefits must be adjusted by the probability that the protections for NCSMNM would be rescinded in the future and discounted from that unknown point in time to the current time.  All of these values are difficult to quantify.

### Number of Small entities

The directly regulated entities are the firms that currently hold at least 1 Northeast US fishing permit that could be used to fish in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts. A few permit categories (Lobster: A1, A2, A4, A5, A5W, A6, and AOC; General Category Scallop B) were not included when constructing the set of directly regulated entities because these permit categories to not enable a vessel to fish in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts areas.  There are a total of 1,338 small firms and 11 Large firms.  1,024 of the small firms derive the majority of their revenue from commercial fishing operations.  314 derive the majority of their revenue from for-hire recreational activities.  Firms that are classified as "for-hire" may still fish commercially -- these firms are included in the tabulation of directly regulated entities, although their main source of income (for-hire fishing) would not be directly impacted  by the proposed action.

Table \ref{tab:Directly_Regulated_Entities} describes numbers of directly regulated entities, their main activities, and their revenues from various sources. The distribution of gross receipts for both classes is highly right-skewed: there are many firms with a small to moderate amount of gross receipts and a handful of firms with much more economic activity. This results in the average receipts being higher than the 75$^th$ percentile of gross receipts for these two groups.

SBA mandates the use of the three most recent years of data to determine whether an entity is small or large.  Using this time period (2019-2021) to describe the importance of NCSMNM to these firms is not appropriate, because the area was not open to fishing for much of this time.  Therefore, the fishing activity during the 2012-2016 time period are used characterize the importance of NCSMNM.  Table \ref{tab:Firm_average_in_Area} describes the Gross Receipts from all sources and from just within the NCSMNM addition. Table \ref{tab:AnyInside} describes the Gross Receipts from all sources and from just within the NCSMNM addition only for firms that fished inside the NCSMNM addition area.  None of the firms classified as "For-Hire" firms were active inside the NCSMNM addition area.

Tables \ref{tab:Firm_average_in_Area}  and \ref{tab:AnyInside} suggest that the NCSMNM addition area are not highly used by fishing firms.  Every year, approximately 100 fishing firms derive some fishing revenue from the NCSMNM addition area (Table \ref{tab:AnyInside}).  Compliance costs, measured as foregone revenue from this area, are expected to be low.  On average, firms derived less than 1\% of annual fishing revenue from this area, and typically substantially less than this.  

```{r AnyInside}

### Percentage of Revenue by Firm

We also plot the percentage of each firm's total commercial fishing revenue derived from inside the NCSMNM addition area (Figure \ref{fig:percent_of_revenue_by_firm}).  Only small firms with revenue from the area are included in the plots; these plots are companions to Table \ref{tab:AnyInside}.  The area inside the boxes of indicate capture the 25$^th$-75$^th$ percentiles, indicating that,  after excluding firms that do not use the NCSMNM addition area, most firms derive a small proportion of their total revenue from the NCSMNM addition area.

Similarly, box-whisker plots of firm's total commercial fishing revenue derived from inside the NCSMNM addition area (Figure \ref{fig:revenue_by_firmAA}) illustrate that most of the firms earn less than \$30,000 in gross receipts from the NCSMNM addition.

Figure \ref{fig:REV_PCT_scatter} plots average annual revenue against the percentage of revenue derived from the NCSMNM addition.  This illustrates that a few firms use the NCSMNM addition for more than 50\% of their gross revenues, but these firms have relatively low gross receipts.  A few firms derive more than $75,000 of revenue from NCSMNM, but these firms earn a low proportion of their total revenue from this area.    


```{r Rev_and_Pct_scatter,eval = T, fig.cap="\\label{fig:REV_PCT_scatter} Scatterplot of percentage of small firm revenue inside NCSMNM against annual firm revenue inside NCSMNM, only firms with some activity inside NCSMNM Addition."}

PCT_Scatter<-PermitInsideRev %>%
  filter(Year=="Total" & Size=="Small") %>%
  mutate(
    InsideREV=InsideREV/num_years/1000,
    InsideLANDED=InsideLANDED/num_years,
    AllREV=AllREV/num_years/1000
  ) %>%

  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100), breaks=seq(0,100,20))+

```{r count_years, fig.cap="\\label{fig:nyears} Histogram of the number of years that small firms were active in the NCSMNM addition. "}

  labs(x = "Number of Years (2012-2016) fished in NCSMNM Addition" ,
       y = "Number of Small Firms Active in NCSMNM Addition")  


```

The NCSMNM addition was not used by every firm in every year. Table \ref{tab:AnyInside} shows that 80-110 firms used the NCSMNM addition each year.  There were `r distinct_firms` that fished in the NCSMNM addition at any point over the 2012-2016 time period.  Many firms did not fish in this area in all years.  Figure \ref{fig:nyears} is a histogram of the number of years each firm fished inside the NCSMNM addition. Almost 60 firms fished there for just 1 year while 33 fished there in all five years.

Together, these tables and figures illustrate that:

1.  Less than 100 small fishing firms (under 10\% of the small firms in the Northeast US) use the NCSMNM addition area  (Tables \ref{tab:Firm_average_in_Area} and \ref{tab:AnyInside}).
2.  Small and Large firms that do use the NCSMNM addition derive only a small proportion of their revenue from the NCSMNM addition (Table \ref{tab:AnyInside}). 
3.  As a percentage of gross receipts, small firms derive slightly more revenue that large firms from NCSMNM  (Table \ref{tab:AnyInside}).
4.  A handful of small firms use the NCSMNM addition for moderate amount of their fishing (Figure \ref{fig:percent_of_revenue_by_firm}).
5.  However, the firms that do derive more than 20\% of their gross receipts from the NCSMNM addition are quite small in size (Figure \ref{fig:REV_PCT_scatter}).

### Compliance Requirements
A description of the projected reporting, record-keeping, and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the requirements of the report or record.

### Duplications
An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules, which may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule.

First, we note that commerical fishing (excepting red crab fishing) is currently prohibited in 82\% of the NCSMNM.  Therefore, the proposed rule somewhat overlaps with the current fishing regulations. 

Second, we note that fishing NCSMNM is currently prohibited by Presidential Proclamation via the Antiquities Act. Proclamations 9496 and 10287 did not contain implementing rules or regulations, but directed the Secretaries of Interior and Commerce to develop them. The proposed rule does precisely that.
